<p>
And travellers, now, within that valley <br>
Through the red-litten windows see <br>
Vast forms that move fantastically <br>
To a discordant melody; <br>
While, like a ghastly rapid river <br> 
Through the pale door <br>
A hideous throng rush out forever <br> 
And laugh â€” <br>
but <span id="smile">smile</span> no more.
